# ML4

## Business question
What tech company is the best fit for me to work in?



## What makes it interesting?
It is interesting because we ourselves are in the tech business and at some point in the future might want to look at jobs in one or more of the mentioned companies. We are curious to examine what the employees value the most in the different companies. Sometimes the expaectations for a job doesn't meet reality so we want to be able recommend a company from how the opinions of the employees.

## Concepts from ML classes

* We will compare various machine learning models in order to find out which one produces the best result.
* We will look compare different scores between the models.
* We will do feature selection.
* We will takes measures to compensate for missing values in the data set

## Data source link
The data contains more than 67,000 employee reviews of their jobs at Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Netflix.

## How can the data help answer the business question?
We want to be able to recommend the best suiteble workplace given that we know which attributes has highest priority for the person. We are basing this on employee reviews because they if any should know how it is to work at the companies.

## Model types
We imagine that we will use at least the following models for our project:
* Neural network
* Support Vector Machine
* Decision tree

## Feature selection

As features we want to look at the following features:
* work-balance-stars: 1-5 rating of how satisfied an employee was with the work/life balance.
* culture-values-stars: 1-5 rating of how satisfied an employee was with the culture and values of the company.
* carrer-opportunities-stars: 1-5 rating of how satisfied an employee was with the carrier oppertunities in the company.
* comp-benefits-stars: 1-5 rating of how satisfied an employee was with the employee benefits/compensations provided by the company.
* senior-management-stars: 1-5 rating of how satisfied an employee was with the senior management at their job.
